   <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Believe, one of our main values is gusto, which means we take
     joy and pride in hard work. As a team, we are committed to developing 
     the whole child. This means fostering interests, talents, and uncovering
     gifts that each student innately has. We strive to create an environment that
     is joyful, so students and staff want to be here.

   <h2 class="history" > history </h2>
     Emerald School was established in 1995 starting with Emerald Nursery and Primary School, Lagos. In
     2005, Emerald High School was established, some of our parents have been clamouring for the establishment
     of a secondary school to enable their wards continue to benefit from the role model building programme of 
     the school. Little wonder then that many of the pioneer students of the High School were products of the 
     Primary School. The trend continues till date.


<p class="border">
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In Emerald, we strive to know each childâ€™s capabilities and lead the child along the line of best fit&

 because we believe every child can learn and every child can become what he/she intends to become.

As a deliberate policy our advertisement campaign has been by word of mouth of parents as we strive 

to meet their aspirations and those of their wards/children. We have continued to compete favourably 

in inter-school competitions with schools that have existed long before us. The records are there to see. 

This has been possible because of our continuous improvement approach to child development, the learning 

resources and infrastructure that we deploy.The school is run strictly on sound management principles with 

clearly defined structures, systems and highly experienced teachers, staff and Board of Advisors.

Identifying with our brand is a step in the right direction because our curriculum and programmes

are designed to meet the needs of our students as they face the changing global demands.
